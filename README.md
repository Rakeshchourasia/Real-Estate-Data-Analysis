Real Estate Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real estate data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Power BI for visualization and SQL for data querying and processing. The goal is to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry, such as property investors, real estate agencies, or market analysts.

Features





Data Cleaning and Transformation: SQL scripts to preprocess and clean raw real estate datasets.



Data Analysis: SQL queries to extract meaningful metrics like average property prices, sales trends, and regional performance.



Interactive Dashboards: Power BI reports and dashboards for visualizing key metrics, including price distributions, market trends, and property type comparisons.



Scalable Pipeline: Modular SQL scripts and Power BI templates for easy adaptation to new datasets.

Tech Stack





SQL: Used for querying, filtering, and aggregating data (compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).



Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.



Dataset: Sample real estate data (e.g., property prices, locations, square footage, sale dates).

Getting Started

Prerequisites





SQL Database: Install MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server to manage the dataset.



Power BI Desktop: Download and install Power BI Desktop for visualization.



Sample Dataset: Use the provided sample dataset (data/sample_real_estate_data.csv) or your own real estate dataset.

Installation




Set Up the Database:





Import the sample dataset into your SQL database using the provided sql/import_data.sql script.



Example for MySQL:

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < sql/import_data.sql



Open Power BI Reports:





Launch Power BI Desktop.



Open the .pbix files in the powerbi/ folder to view pre-built dashboards.



Update the data source in Power BI to point to your SQL database.

Usage





Run SQL Queries:





Use the sql/clean_data.sql script to preprocess the dataset (e.g., handle missing values, standardize formats).



Execute queries in sql/analysis_queries.sql to generate metrics like average price per region or top-performing property types.



Visualize in Power BI:





Open powerbi/real_estate_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.



Connect to your SQL database to refresh the data.



Explore interactive visualizations, such as:





Price trends over time



Property distribution by region



Sales volume by property type



Customize:





Modify SQL queries to analyze additional metrics.



Update Power BI visuals to include new charts or filters based on your needs.

Example Insights





Price Trends: Identify rising or falling property prices by region or property type.



Market Segmentation: Analyze which property types (e.g., apartments, houses) are most popular in specific areas.



Investment Opportunities: Highlight regions with high return potential based on historical data.
